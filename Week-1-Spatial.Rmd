```{r data}
counties <- counties(state = "CO")
roads <- roads(state = "CO", county = "Larimer")
tmap_mode("view")
```

# 4. Exercises 

## 1. Filter out the counties data set to only include Larimer, Denver, and Pueblo counties.

```{r}
counties<-counties%>%
  filter(NAME %in% c("Larimer", "Denver", "Pueblo"))
```

## 2. Make a map of the counties data colored by county area. Make a second map of counties colored by their total area of water.

```{r}

```


## 3. Make a barplot comparing the elevation of your 3 points in the Poudre Canyon (note: explore the extract() function in the terra package).

## 4. Why are there 4 features in our Poudre Canyon Highway variable instead of 1?
